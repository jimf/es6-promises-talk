# ES6 Promise Examples - Unit Testing with Tape

Example code that tests our DummyComponent module with [Tape][tape] and nothing
else. This example was intentionally left ultra-minimal, partly to showcase
that no extra bells and whistles are necessarily needed to do TDD, and partly
to differ from the other examples in the complete absence of mocking. For added
promise integration, [blue-tape][blue-tape] is available as an exercise for the
reader.

## Try it out
